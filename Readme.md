# Cher Ami Insurance

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine
2. Set up the environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

4. On a new terminal, run the migration and the seed script to add initial data:

```bash
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma migrate dev
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma db seed
```

5. That’s it!

You can see the app on `http://localhost:3000`

The API should be running on `http://localhost:4000`

** Note **
If you want to install new dependencies, you'll have to do it inside the docker container. To do that, you can use the following command:

```
# On the root directory of the project
docker compose exec {backend OR frontend} yarn add {the_name_of_the_package}
```

Make sure to replace the values between the curly braces `{}` with the correct ones.


## Running tests
```bash
docker compose exec backend yarn test
```


## API

After following the [Getting started](#Getting-started) guide, the backend should be running on port `4000`. The backend has following endpoints:

| Request type | Path           | Query Params | Example                   |

| `PUT`        | `/policies/id` | ``           | `/policies/4e15b4e0`      |
| `DELETE`     | `/policies/id` | ``           | `/policies/4e15b4e0`      |
